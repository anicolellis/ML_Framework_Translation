# ML_Framework_Translation
During my 2021 summer internship, I was tasked with translating code from using Tensorflow/Keras to Pytorch.
This was my first time working with ML code.

tc1_baseline_keras2: This is the original file.
tc1_pytorch and tc1_pytorch2: These are the files I worked on, in which I translated the original file to a new framework.
